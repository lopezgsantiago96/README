Data extraction and analysis on company performance for Mavenfuzzyfactory
This is an analysis project I did for an advanced MYSQL course where I played the role of a business analyst and my objective was to retrieve data from the database and provide some insights on the performance of the company in different metrics for the purpose of preparing a story for the company's next round of funding. The problems and solutions on the database that you will see below are all based on the final project of the course where I worked with the Mavenfuzzyfactory database built by Maven Analytics. So I hope you enjoy it!
